# UFOs Analysis

## Project Overview
Dana has hired me to help analyze UFO sightings by allowing users to filter the sightings based on multiple criteria.

1.	Remove previously added button functionality and replace it with dynamic updates
2.	Add additional filters for the city, state, country, and shape of the sighting
3.	Deploy the changes onto a website.
## Challenge Overview

## Resources
-Data Source: data.js

## Results
To use the webpage one fills out any of the filters one wishes to use and presses enter.
  
  
  Examples:
 ![Statesort](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109701875/195481154-076b85e5-b724-44bc-8b51-12a03a0c9eeb.PNG)
 (sorted by state)

(sorted bt state and shape)

  
  
## Summary
One drawback of the current design is that the results are case sensitive and do not allow for misspellings. This means typo or capitalization can result in a bad search. One recommendation would be to remove the case sensitive nature of the results by converting everything into one case. Another recommendation for development to would be to add a filter for comments  that were made about the sighting.
